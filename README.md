### Be Your Own Gallery

VIEW YOUR DIGITAL ARTWORK COLLECTION ANYTIME, ANYWHERE

At home, on vacation, on the train  — never be without your digital art collection. 
Digital artworks you own as NFTs on Ethereum, Feral File, or Tezos will automatically appear in your Autonomy. 

You would never display a piece of art in your home without thinking about how to frame and light it. Autonomy + iPhone lets you set up your personal NFT art gallery anywhere you go, instantly - on your phone, at home, at parties. It’s a seamless, customizable new way to enjoy your digital art collection across your phone, TVs, and projectors.

#### UNIFY
View your entire NFT collection from platforms including OpenSea, Art Blocks, Hic et Nunc, fxhash, and Feral File. Autonomy supports NFTs on Ethereum (ERC-721), Bitmark, and Tezos blockchains using WalletConnect and Beacon.

#### DISPLAY
View your collection on TVs and projectors including over AirPlay.

#### UPGRADES
For the serious digital art collector, subscribe for $4.99/month to experience your art in physical spaces with TVs and projectors. You can also preserve and authenticate your artworks for the long-term.
